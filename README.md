# Hello world


## Description

> In this exercise I've used the react-rails gem. This gem allows you to build React components as a part of your Rails JavaScript and serve it in a component, react_component, to be used in a regular ERB file.


## Learning objectives

- Implement a connection between a Ruby on Rails back-end and React front-end.
- Understand the pros and cons of different approaches of connecting Ruby on Rails back-end with React front-end.
